## Fallen Tree Roots
Demo image of a tree trunk fallen down by heavy winds. The roots of tree are visible and serve as simple example to align the left and right image to accomplish a 3D perception of the roots in the forest. Can be used as demo images for the stereoscopy app for testing and learning (anaglyph images or other stereoscopy image).

### Left Eye - Right Eye Image
Images with the extension `..._left.png` or `..._left.jpg` denote the image for the left eye and `..._right.png` or  or `..._right.jpg` denote the image for the right eye. 


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Left Eye Image</th>
    <th>Right Eye Image</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="fallen_tree_roots_left.jpg"  alt="1" width = 360px ></td>
    <td><img src="fallen_tree_roots_right.jpg" alt="2" width = 360px ></td>
   </tr> 
  </tr>
</table>

### Anaglyph - Stereoscopy Image
The generated [anaglyph image](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) has the extension `..._anglyph.png` and 
the generated [stereoscopy image](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) left and right eye image next 
to eachother has the extension `..._stereoscopy.png`. 

All images share the same basename `fallen_tree_roots` and the images are collected 
in a directory with the corresponding basename.
